###### Details and further scope
* This is a look alike of mole in the whole game by using vanilla javascript. 
I have many ideas of improvement in the game so if you like it, do visit back in few days for advancements in code.
Some ideas are:
* adding a hoverable timer
*  bring more challenges like less time or uncertain time
* adding your name using localStorage
